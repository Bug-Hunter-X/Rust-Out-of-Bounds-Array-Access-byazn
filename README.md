This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which will panic at runtime if an index is out of bounds. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that uses safe methods to handle potential index errors, preventing runtime panics. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling when working with arrays and vectors in Rust.
